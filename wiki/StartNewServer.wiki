#summary Starting a Server via 'Start New Server' Menu

Since: RotU 2.2.1

Status: Draft

= Introduction =
The files downloaded simply by playing RotU on someone's server are insufficient to properly start a RotU server.  You will need to download additional files and configure your server.

= Details =

In addition to the files downloaded by playing on someone's server you will need to get the RotU server-side files:

  * rotu_svr_scripts.iwd
  * rotu_svr_custom.iwd
  * rotu_svr_mapdata.iwd
  * admin.cfg
  * server.cfg
  * mapvote.cfg
  * weapons.cfg
  * damage.cfg
  * didyouknow.cfg
  * easy.cfg

These files must be in your RotU mod folder.  You can get them from the binary release of RotU 2.2.1, or from any later release.  The default version of the config files are also available from svn HEAD.  The iwd files can be built with makeMod.pl if you have a RotU development environment set up.  You will need to edit the config files as though your were setting up a real public server.

When you try to start the server, 'Pure:' must be set to 'No'.
