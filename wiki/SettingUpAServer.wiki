===Create a folder for RotU 2.2===
  You will need to create a folder inside the Mods folder on your server.  You should choose a name that is unique to your server(s).  If you choose a name that others are likely to choose, you will force your players to repeatedly download different versions of the same files as they play on different servers.  If you run multiple servers, and want players' rank to be the same on each server, use the same folder name on all the servers.  If you want them to be different, then use different folder names on each of your servers.  For example, on Pulsar's servers, we will likely use 'rotu22pza' and 'rotu22pzaeasy'.

===Upload the Server Files===
  Upload the following files to the folder you created inside the Mods folder on your server:
  * 2d.iwd
  * rotu_svr_custom.iwd
  * rotu_svr_scripts.iwd
  * sound.iwd
  * weapons.iwd
  * yz_custom.iwd
  * mod.ff
  * admin.cfg
  * damage.cfg
  * didyouknow.cfg
  * easy.cfg
  * mapvote.cfg
  * server.cfg
  * weapons.cfg
  * ban.txt (create an empty file, or use a previous ban file)
