ROTU Change Log

//
// 2.2
//
* Secondary abilities in UI cleaned up to prevent the UI from tricking players into
  thinking there are actually secondary abilities
* The abilities shown on the class menu are actually implemented now
* New 'Last Man Standing' ability for soldiers, scouts, and engineers: 80% less
  damage while reviving if they are the last player alive
* Player Alive/Down counts are now correct, so the game will never think there
  are still players alive when everyone is actually down
* The bug that lead to the assassin's invincibility glitch and spectator glitching
  is fixed
* The HUD now displays current wave / total waves
* You can now have an arbitrary number of waves
* You can now have an arbitrary number of special waves up to one wave less than
  the total waves
* The order of the regular and special waves is now pseudo-random
* New zombie type: burning (exploding) dogs.  Running dogs with flames, they
  explode when killed.
* New zombie type: burning (exploding) tank zombies.  Tank (hell) zombies with flames,
  they explode when killed.
* New zombie type: cyclops. Like a boss zombie, but much easier to kill, and can
  be damaged with gun fire as well as explosives and knifing.
* New special wave type: cyclops.  1-2 fewer cyclops than the number of players,
  with at least one cyclops.
* New special wave type: runners.  Nothing but sprinting zombies.
* New special wave type: burning dog.  Burning (exploding) dogs.
* New special wave type: burning tank (hell).  Burning (exploding) tank zombies.
* New special wave type: inferno.  Inferno is a pseudo-random mix of burning
  zombies, burning dogs, and burning tank.
* New special wave type: random.  A pseudo-random mix of all the special zombies
* Only admin can leave and rejoin the game during a wave.  Regular players must
  wait until the current wave is finished to rejoin.
* Admin can join a game, even if there are not enough survivors alive.
* In regular waves, every nth zombie is a pseudo-random special zombie.  Default
  is every 10th, configurable.
* The number of zombies in a special wave is now 33% of what the regular wave
  would be instead of 25%, and this setting is now configurable.
* In the second half of the game, zombies' health, damage, and speed increases
  between 20% and 60% for various zombies. You can now scale these overall increases
  from 0% to 100%.
* Up to 60 in-game 'Did You Know' messages, configurable.  Four are scrolled though
  between each wave.
* Claymores are now implemented
* C4 now works, even if the player had once become a zombie.
* Per-player maximum emplaced and on-hand claymores and C4 is settable in weapons.cfg.
  Max on-hand ammo for these weapons is still governed by their respective weapon_mp files.
* New welcome messages welcome a player by name, and tell them their prestige level
* Players get an upgrade point bonus for each prestige level when they first join
  the game.
* Special weapons are implemented and available during the last half of the game to
  players that have prestiged and continue to prestige as possible.
* New map voting UI.  Allows for 13 pseudo-random maps to be displayed.  Option to replay the
  current map if the players lost.  New 'None of The Above' option gives players a second
  chance at voting with a new map selection.  The UI tells you which map you have
  voted for, and lists the players that voted for each map, in real-time.
* Map voting no longer depends on the map rotation dvar, but instead uses up to
  seven of its own dvars, allowing for well over 175 maps to be available for voting.
* It is now possible to specify a list of maps that should appear in map voting
  at a reduced frequency, and also at a greatly reduced frequency.
* Map voting uses an English name (configurable) for the maps rather than the code
  name for the map
* The source code and the configuration files are now documented with doxygen-style
  documentation.
* New admin system with fine-grain powers allows the server owner great flexibility
  in granting admin powers.
* New in-game admin menu for punishing, warning, banning, and rewarding players.
  The menu also permits finishing or restarting waves and maps, as well as changing
  the map.  Admin can operate in a stealth session where their actions are not
  broadcast to other players (default setting) or they can make their session visible
  so players are informed of their actions.  Admin can cure, revive, down, teleport,
  healing aura, ammo can, promote, demote, give upgrade points, and much more.
* New warning system warns, then temp bans and perm bans for language and regular
  warnings (distinct counts). Warnings are persistent just like rank.  How many
  warnings of each type will result in a temp ban or a permanent ban is configurable.
* New debugging system that can print function entrance messages, value messages,
  and emitted signals.  Debugging system has seven verbosity levels.
* New headicons for admin, engineers, medics, and moderately-low health.
* The number of assassins, engineers, and medics in the game is now limited.  These
  limits do not apply to admin.
* New demerits system that issues persistent demerits for being a poor team player.
  After 20 demerits (configurable), the player loses 500 rank points.
* Over 175 maps have been tested with 2.2.  Those that cause griveous errors are
  black-listed so they cannot be voted on or loaded.  Our test server currently
  has 150 maps that are known to work and may be voted on.
* Thousands of run-time errors and race conditions have been fixed.
* The 2.2 server starts/restarts very quickly compared to 2.1.
* Several maps have been fixed to resolve precache and bg_fallDamage[Min|Max]Height issues
* dustrailsIR effect is now precached in the mod to fix maps that call for the effect
  but don't precache it themselves.  Ditto for com_bottle[1|2|3|4].
* Minimap shows a 'kill' objective on each player-zombie to help others find and
  kill them
* Minimap show a flashing red exclamation mark on down players to help others find them
* 'Autotext' feature tells players when a player is down, and asks them to revive
  if possible
* Players now get rank and upgrade points for covering the revival of another player
  during a wave
* The number of rank points for large killing sprees has been greatly reduced to limit
  the benefit of spree glitching
* Ammo boxes are now biased towards other players and non-engineers.  The primary way for an engineer
  to get ammo is to use their special.  The better an engineer is at giving other
  players ammo, the more frequently they can throw an ammo box.  Special weapons
  are now (slowly) reloadable from ammo boxes.
* MG + barrel now works without force-disconnecting players
* Player spawn protection makes players invincible for 2 seconds after they spawn
* PERL script to merge ban.txt files from multiple mods on multiple servers (manual
  downloading and uploading still required).
* ***DEPRECATED*** Multiple compile scripts so you can re-compile just the portions that you have
  changed rather than the entire mod.  Also scripts to facilitate using subversion
  and uploading files to the game server.
* New build system, makeMod.pl, builds the mod without leaving detritus laying about.
  It will only rebuild the parts that need to be rebuilt, based on changes it detects
  to the source code.  It can be forced to do a full rebuild.  It can perform a multitude
  of code-quality checks.  It can produce a listing of every function definition and
  where it is defined, and each place it is used in the code.  It creates debug and
  non-debug versions of the server scripts.  It can clean the mod, removing almost
  all traces that it had ever been there.
* About two-dozen deprecated files have been removed.
* Players get no points for killing a burning zombie if they damage a teammate in
  the process
* New end-game credits display, with multiple server providers permitted in the config file
* Server.cfg file has been split into several smaller config files, including an
  easy.cfg to facilitate running an 'easy' version of the game
* Grenade and minigun defense turrets now work, and are configurable in weapons.cfg. Each
  player may own only one turret at a time.  Turrets disappear when they run out
  of ammo, not after a preset time. Grenade and minigun turrets are unlocked at
  different prestige levels (configurable).  Turrets do not lag the game.
* Players now get upgrade points for damaging a player-zombie, to help defray the
  cost of expended ammunition and such.
* New string library
* New array library
* New matrix library
* Can turn on/off each type of debug statement from server.cfg, and also set the
  debug verbosity.
* Auto-spawning when the next wave begins or when there are enough player's alive
  now works.
* Can change class anytime and respawn immediately, if you have enough upgrade points.
  The cost of changing your class is the sum of health + ammo + cure from the shop
* Admin menu works while spectating, hit the 'use' key to open
* Development console "admin:" messages configurable in server.cfg
* Removed source of burning human and ambient sound errors when building the mod.
  Only the non-consequential rumble errors remain.
* Axis and Allies team names can now be set in server.cfg
* Final Zombie now has up to four kill methods: explosives, primary weapon, sidearm,
  and knifing.  Each type can be turned on/off from server.cfg.  Each type also has
  a difficulty factor, configurable in server.cfg, to make each type easier or
  harder.  There is also a new factor set in server.cfg to make the kill balls
  appear more or less frequently.
* The number of zombies in the next wave is now calculated just before the wave
  starts instead of immediately after the previous wave ended.
* Timeout that ends god-mode when the admin menu is closed is settable in admin.cfg
* Teleporters now work properly on legacy maps (maps that don't use waypoints)
* Future home of the source code: http://code.google.com/p/reign-of-the-undead/

//
// 2.2 Release Show-stoppers
//
* The usables system needs some TLC after extensive efforts to kill the unrevivable bug
* Finish initial documentation in the wiki on the new source code website
* Numerous code cleanups and function documentation required.

//
// 2.2 Known Issues
//
* Need more work to kill the insidious 'unrevivable' bug
* Demerits for not reviving enough players between waves (faked until
  unrevivable bug is fixed).
* 'No Die Handlier for entity type 12' bug is still unresolved (related to
  helicopter, i.e. medkits)
* staticbarricade errors from a handful of maps, such as parkorman and mrx_castle.
  These maps are blacklisted.
* Rare overflow crash bug in the new mapvoting system: likely fixed for 20-human-slot
  servers, may reappear on servers with more slots.
* Defense turrets sometimes stop firing.  In-game workaround: The owning player must
  pick up and re-emplace the turret.
* The source of the rumble errors when building the mod.ff is individual [weapon]_mp
  files calling for the files raw/rumble/silencer_fire, raw/rumble/defaultweapon_melee,
  and raw/rumble/defaultweapon_fire.  Those files call the _h and _l versions of
  the rumble files.
* Demerits issued when a sentry turrets kills burning zombies and damages another player,
  but you shouldn't get demerits for that (grrr, and the code agrees, strange bug).


//
// 2.2+ Feature ideas
//
* New final zombie wave type: Multiple time-staggered final zombies depending on
  how many players are in the game
* Adaptive zombie slot system.  Will assign some open player slots to zombies to make
  maximum use of slots the server provider is paying for.
* End-game stats.  Will appear before the end credits, and will not duplicate information
  shown in the scoreboard.  Likely be 'most revives', 'most revive covering',
  'best kill/death ratio', and 'most valuable player', 'best medic', 'best engineer'.
* Replacing the scoreboard team icons with something more zombie-appropriate
* 'Broken Arrow' feature that uses off-map support to kill most zombies when a team
  is about to be overrun.
* Blue ball ban feature
* Improved music system
* Player pause feature, for 60 seconds


//
// 2.2.1 Changes (>= r40)
//
* Enable night vision by default, and at no cost.
* Note in admin_default.cfg that at least one admin must be defined for the mod to run
* Fix teleporters and MG+Barrels so they cannot be emplaced too close to a shop or
  weapons crate.
* Fix bug where 'Restore Ammo' at shop restored c4, claymores, and tnt, which permitted
  players to exceed the per-player limits.  'Restore Ammo' now only restores bullets
  and grenades, as intended.
* Implement TNT.
* Make frag grenades hurt final zombie on 'explosives' kill method
* Added a clan-specific message to the main menu.  Configurable in server.cfg.
* Fix for rare bug where barrels appeared to be 'stuck' to a player after they
  tried to emplace the barrel. See Issue 6.
* Issue where rcon password sometimes changed has been fixed.
* Add ability to sometimes, always, or never show zombies on the minimap.  Configurable
  in server.cfg
* Force players to automatically drop a MG+Barrel turret when it runs out of ammo, so their
  body doesn't become hidden if they don't drop the turret immediately.
* Fix for an admin sometimes not being recognized as an admin such that they can't open the
  admin menu.  The issue presented itself when multiple admins connected to the game within
  one second of each other.
* Reduce start and max ammo for the gold desert eagle from 500 to 250 rounds.
* Deprecate and remove the 2.1 map voting system
* Deprecate and remove _zombiescipt2.gsc and _zombiescript - kopie.gsc
* Increased sv_maptoing dvars to 10, which will allow for about 250 maps
* Support 12 of the CoD4 built-in maps via UMI--the rest have too many xmodels and will
  never work with RotU
* Enable 'Start New Server' command from RotU menu.  You will need a full install
  of RotU--the files downloaded while playing on somone's server are insufficient.
* New Unified Mapping Interface (UMI) replaces _zombiescript. Maps written to the _zombiescript
  interface will continue to work.  We can now load maps that require external BTD
  waypoints and tradespawns.  New file rotu_srv_mapdata.iwd holds tradespawn, waypoint,
  and main script files for non-native RotU maps. I will be writing a wiki tutorial with
  example files for mappers.  New UMI dev functions to convert RotU waypoints to BTD
  waypoints and vice-versa. New admin development functions that allow an admin to
  be given, emplace, delete, and pick up weapon and equipment shops.  When they are
  satisfied with the shop locations, 'Save Tradespawns' will write a new tradespawns
  file to the server log.
* Support three non-RotU maps via UMI: mp_prunis, mp_burgundy_bulls, and mp_arkona_osg.
  We are not distributing these maps--just the files we wrote and the data required
  to make them run in RotU 2.2.1.  You can get the maps from the usual places.

//
// 2.2.2 Changes (>= r105)
//
* New UMI Map Editor.  Allows creating, editing, linking, and moving waypoints in-game
  when the map is launched in UMI Editor mode.  The editing menu is available from b then 5
  in-game.
* Improved bot elevation following logic helps prevent bots from getting stuck in stairs.
* Improved waypoints and tradespawns for map mp_pipeline.
* Removed the gameboy-like normal map from claymores.
* Removed many unused images from yz_custom.iwd.
* TNT now works after having been a zombie.
* Limit TNT to one per on-screen ammo box to prevent engineers from killing all the
  zombies themselves.
* AI tweak to make zombies target other players faster when their original target
  goes down.
* New 'New Player Assistance' feature to make the game easier for new players while
  they learn how to play.  When they go down, they are auto-revived, cured,
  given some upgrade points, and told to 'run to survive'.  This assistance ends
  at prestige level 0, rank 30.  New players are limited to 3 assists per wave,
  then they go down as normal.
* Native GIMP *.xcf masks to facilitate skinning player uniforms.  This required
  some changes to the models used for players, so if you were using custom uniforms
  already, you will need to customize images for the new models.
* Explicitly include the dvars needed for special weapons in weapons.cfg
* Various improvements to the special weapons.
* Fix bug where prestige 38 used the prestige 3 icon.
* Add 20 additional prestige levels; max prestige is now 65.
* Engineer's ammo special now recharges both primary and seconday weapon ammo supply.
* Improved waypoints for mp_creek and mp_farm.
* Initial waypoints and tradspawns for map mp_brecourt_v2.
* Improved waypoints for map mpsurv_new_moon_lg.
* New 'many_bosses' option for final wave.
* Deprecated and removed the RotU 2.1 wave count system
* Reduced rank points for killing sprees and increased the rank points required for
  each promotion. Between this and the extra prestige levels, it should now take
  about 3 times as much game-play to max out your prestige.
* Split server.cfg into server.cfg and game.cfg to facilitate getting local servers
  working properly.
* Starting Listen, LAN, and Internet servers now works as expected via playMod.bat,
  host.bat, and join.bat.
* Removed recoil from raygun so players can't use it to help get outside of maps.
* Added a dvar to allow raygun to be purchased anytime, though I think this hurts
  gameplay.  The prestige limits still apply.
* Improved waypoints and anti-glitching fixes in map mp_surv_zombiedesert.
* Initial waypoints for map mp_surv_boss_road.
* Add two unrestricted machine guns to map mp_surv_tunnel so that it is actually
  possible to beat the map.
* In the UMI Map Editor, if there are more waypoint links than the line() function
  will draw, only draw the links within 2500 units of the dev player.
