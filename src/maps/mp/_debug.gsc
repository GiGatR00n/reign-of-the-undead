/**
 * @file _debug.gsc This file contains the settings for the debug system
 *
 * The implementation of the debug system is in scripts/include/utility.gsc
 *
 * The debug system consists of the debugPrint(), warnPrint(), noticePrint(), and
 * errorPrint() functions, as well as the settings here.  The build system, makeMod.pl,
 * creates debug and non-debug versions of the rotu server scripts.  For the non-debug
 * version, it removes certain lines from the source code, while preserving the
 * new line characters so error messages in console_mp.log still refer to the correct
 * lines.  The three types of code the script removes are, in precedence order are:
 *
 * 1)   Any lines containing and between <debug></debug> tags following a C++ style
 *      comment, e.g.
 *      \code
 *      // <debug>
 *      for (i=0; i<level.players.size; i++) {
 *          level.players[i].headicon = "myTestHeadicon";
 *      }
 *      // </debug>
 *      \endcode
 *      N.B. the entire line containing a <debug> or </debug> tag is removed!
 *
 * 2)   Any single line containing a self-closing <debug /> tag inside of a C++ style
 *      comment.  This is useful for denoting that a function call should only be
 *      made when in debug mode, e.g. \code printPlayersInGame(); // <debug />\endcode
 *
 * 3)   Almost all lines containing debugPrint() function calls, e.g.
 *      \code debugPrint("in adminInterface::doAwesomeThing()", "fn", level.nonVerbose); \endcode
 *      or
 *      \code debugPrint("The player's name is: " + self.name, "val"); \endcode
 *      N.B. warnPrint(), errorPrint(), and noticePrint() statements are never removed
 *      (unless they happen to be in a debug block!).  Also, 'debugPrint(' must
 *      be the first non-whitespace string on the line, e.g. the line
 *      \code if (test) {debugPrint("my test", "val");} \endcode will not be removed.

     * In a 15-wave game with about seven players, there is on the order of five
     * million function calls.

     * The 21 most-called functions account for about 95% of all function calls.
     * We do not place function entrance debugging statements on those functions
     * (and we place a comment there to remind us not to do so).
     *
     * The remaining 225,000 or so calls are broken up to represent a roughly
     * geometric series, where each debug verbosity level will print about half
     * as many function calls as the level above it (or each higher level prints
     * about twice as many statements as all the lower levels combined, whatever
     * makes the most sense to you).
